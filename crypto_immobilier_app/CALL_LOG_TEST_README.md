  - 📥 Incoming calls (green icon)
  - 📤 Outgoing calls (blue icon) 
  - ❌ Missed calls (red icon)
  - 🚫 Rejected calls (red icon)
- Shows phone number/contact name
- Displays date & time of call
- Shows call duration

### ✅ Test Call Feature
- Floating action button to make test calls
- Calls test number: +1234567890
- Instructions dialog after initiating call
- Refresh button to update call logs after test

### ✅ Permissions Handling
- Requests phone permissions on startup
- Shows permission dialog if access denied
- Graceful handling of permission states

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### Dependencies Added
```yaml
dependencies:
  call_log: ^4.0.0
  permission_handler: ^11.1.0
  url_launcher: ^6.2.1
  intl: ^0.19.0
```

### Android Permissions
Added to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CALL_PHONE" />
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Install & Run
```bash
cd crypto_immobilier_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### 2. Grant Permissions
- App will request call log and phone permissions
- Grant all required permissions when prompted
- If denied, use "Open Settings" to grant manually

### 3. View Call History
- **Historique tab**: View all existing calls on device
- **Input / Output tab**: Switch between incoming/outgoing views
- Pull to refresh or use refresh button to update

### 4. Test Call Functionality
- Tap the green "Test Call" floating action button
- App will initiate call to +1234567890
- End the call immediately (it's just for testing)
- Tap refresh button in AppBar
- New call should appear in both Historique and Outgoing lists

### 5. Verify Call Extraction
- Check that the test call appears with:
  - ✅ Correct phone number (+1234567890)
  - ✅ Current date/time
  - ✅ Outgoing call icon (📤)
  - ✅ Proper duration (even if 0 seconds)

## 📱 UI Components

### Main Screen Structure
```
AppBar (with drawer icon + refresh button)
├── Drawer Menu
│   ├── Settings (placeholder)
│   ├── Logout (placeholder)
│   └── About (functional)
├── Body Content
│   ├── Historique Tab: Complete call list
│   └── Input/Output Tab: Filtered calls with sub-tabs
├── Bottom Navigation Bar
│   ├── Historique
│   └── Input / Output
└── Floating Action Button: Test Call
```

### Call List Items
Each call displays:
- **Leading**: Circle avatar with call type icon
- **Title**: Contact name or phone number + call type badge
- **Subtitle**: 
  - Phone number (if contact name exists)
  - Date & time
  - Call duration

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues
- If call logs don't load: Check app permissions in Android settings
- Navigate: Settings > Apps > Crypto Immobilier > Permissions
- Enable "Phone" and "Call Log" permissions

### Test Call Not Appearing
- Ensure call was actually made and ended
- Tap refresh button after ending call
- Check if phone has call log restrictions
- Verify app has CALL_PHONE permission

### No Calls Showing
- Device might have no call history
- Make a few test calls first
- Check permission status in app

## 📋 Expected Results

After successful testing, you should observe:

1. ✅ **Permission Grant**: App successfully requests and receives call log permissions
2. ✅ **Call History Display**: Existing device calls appear in Historique tab
3. ✅ **Filtering Works**: Input/Output tab correctly separates incoming/outgoing
4. ✅ **Test Call Integration**: New outgoing test calls appear in logs after refresh
5. ✅ **UI Responsiveness**: Bottom navigation and drawer work smoothly
6. ✅ **Data Accuracy**: Call information (number, time, duration) displays correctly

## 🚀 Next Steps

This test page validates that call log extraction works on Android. For production integration:

1. **Replace test number** with actual client numbers
2. **Add call logging to backend** via API calls
3. **Implement real Settings/Logout** functionality
4. **Add call categorization** (client types, follow-ups)
5. **Integrate with visit scheduling** workflow
6. **Add call notes and client information** capture

The core call log extraction mechanism is now proven to work and ready for integration into the full real estate management app.
